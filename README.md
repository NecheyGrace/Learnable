# Version Control Mastery

## Understanding Version Control

Definition: A system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to:
Revert to previous versions
Collaborate with others efficiently
Maintain a history of project evolution
Benefits:
Prevents accidental data loss
Enables parallel work on different features
Facilitates code reviews and debugging
Provides insights into project history
## Git vs. GitHub

Git:
Version control system (VCS) software
Runs locally on your computer
Tracks changes, creates branches, manages merges
Free and open-source
GitHub:
Cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories
Offers online storage, collaboration features, issue tracking
Popular for open-source projects and private development
## GitHub Alternatives

GitLab: Comprehensive open-source platform with self-hosting options
Bitbucket: Atlassian's offering, strong for enterprise integration
SourceForge: Veteran platform, extensive open-source project hosting
## Git Fetch vs. Git Pull

Git Fetch:
Downloads new commits from a remote repository to your local machine
Doesn't automatically merge changes into your current branch
Git Pull:
Combines git fetch and git merge
Fetches commits and integrates them into your current branch
## Git Rebase

Purpose: Rewriting history by moving a branch's base to a new commit
Benefits:
Cleaner commit history
Avoids merge commits
Command:
```
git rebase <base-branch>
```
